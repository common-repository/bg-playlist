The following tag attributes are used: `<a>`:`<a class="wpaudio" href="https://sitename.com/path/filename.mp3" title="Track title" alt="Track discription" data-artist="Artist name" data-album="Album title" data-length="123">Track caption</a>`* `class="wpaudio"` - class name of the link to the audio file. By default: **wpaudio**. Can be changed in plugin settings.* `href="https://sitename.com/path/filename.mp3"` - audio file URL. Relative path is allowed (by default relative to the site root).* `title="Track title"` - the track title - displayed in the player header. If is empty, the **link text** is accepted. If **link text** is also empty, then track title and track caption is filename **filename.mp3**.* `alt="Track discription"` - track discription.* `data-artist="Artist name"` - artist name.* `data-album="Album title"` - album title. If the album title is not set in this tag, then the album title  is the post title.* `data-length="123"` - track length in seconds. * `Track caption - link text`  - track caption. If **link text** is not specified, then the **title** -- **artist name** is displayed instead.In the link text is allowed to use the html-tags: `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<b>`, `<s>`, `<del>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`, `<small>`, `<span class="" style ="">`.If the first character of the link text is `#`, then **link text** is ignored in player, and the **title** -- **artist name** is displayed instead.To set **track image** paste it into the link text:`<a class="wpaudio" ...><img src="https://sitename.com/path/image.png" width="48" height="64" />Track title</a>`In automatic mode (default is off), the plug-in parse the post contents and instead of the text that located between the first and last audio links, inserts the standard WP player with playlist that included of the found audio links.If for a post to create an custom field **single_audio** with any value other than an empty string, then each link will be treated as a separate playlist with a single track.**Enclosing shortcode** `[audiodisk] ... [/audiodisk]` allows you to reduce the range of search for links on the page to text located inside the shortcode tags. This gives you more flexibility to edit posts, allows you to create multiple playlists on single page. **Self-closing shortcode** `[audiodisk src ="https://sitename.com/path/playlist.m3u" /]` allows you to insert a player with a pre-configured playlist,there is **src** - link to the playlist file in the formats **m3u** or **pls**. You can set relative path to the file.The plugin adds "Downoad" button for each track in the standard WP player.You can disable playlist looping with same named option.In TinyMCE Editor added three buttons: "Insert audiolink", "Insert audiodisk" and "Insert playlist". "Insert audiolink" allows insert tag `<a>` with all attributes."Insert audiodisk" inserts enclosing shortcode `[audiodisk] ... [/audiodisk]` around selected text. The same button "Аudiodisk" available in editor text mode too."Insert playlist" inserts self-closing shortcode `[audiodisk src ="https://sitename.com/path/playlist.m3u" /]`.Plugin will added automaticly attribute `data-length` in link while post saving. It's works if audiofile placed on the same site only. == Screenshots == 1. Scheme of audioplayer elements1. General settings1. Player appearance settings1.
